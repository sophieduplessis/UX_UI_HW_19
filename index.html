        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Working in hatted fine dining for 10 years + and in the events and music production industry for nearly 20 I have acquired a very unique skill set. I believe everything is UX and its applications go beyond purely the digital realm. Empathy and understanding are my greatest tools when designing and solving human centric products and UI solutions. Psychology, assumptions from stakeholders and users inform initial design but my greatest passion is user testing. Research and user testing allow me to focus on the problem, if it exists and to create solutions the user actually needs.</p>

                <p>Moderated face to face interviews are my favourite tools for research.

                <p>I like to take the entire journey of a users from before they engage, during engagement and after they finish, only then can you truly understand motivations and pains.
                     No-one exists in a bubble and the wider you go the more likely you will catch those answers.</p>
